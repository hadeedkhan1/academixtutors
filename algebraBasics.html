            <h2>What is Algebra?</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our comprehensive guide to algebra, where we delve deep into the intricacies of this fundamental branch of mathematics. Whether you're a student grappling with algebraic equations or a parent seeking resources to support your child's learning journey, this article is designed to equip you with the knowledge and tools needed to conquer algebra with confidence. At its core, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols to solve problems. It extends beyond basic arithmetic by introducing variables, which are symbols that represent numbers. These variables can stand for unknown quantities, allowing us to solve equations and explore patterns and relationships in a wide range of mathematical contexts.

            <h2>The Building Blocks of Algebra</h2>
            <p>Before diving into the complexities of algebraic expressions and equations, it's essential to have a solid understanding of the foundational concepts:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Numbers and Operations:</b> Algebra builds upon the principles of arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Mastery of these operations is crucial for solving algebraic problems efficiently.</li>
            <li><b>Variables and Constants:</b> In algebra, variables such as \(x\) and \(y\) are used to represent unknown quantities, while constants are fixed values. Understanding how to manipulate variables and constants is key to solving equations and inequalities.</li>
            <li><b>Expressions and Equations:</b> An algebraic expression is a combination of variables, constants, and mathematical operations, while an equation asserts that two expressions are equal. Learning to translate real-world problems into algebraic expressions and equations is a fundamental skill in algebra.</li>
            <li><b>Functions and Graphs:</b> Functions describe relationships between variables, mapping inputs to outputs. Graphing functions allow us to visualize these relationships and analyze their behavior over different domains.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Algebraic Operations</h2>
            <p>Algebraic operations enable us to perform various transformations on expressions and equations. These operations include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Simplification:</b> Combining like terms, distributing terms, and applying the order of operations (PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) are essential techniques for simplifying algebraic expressions.</li>
            <li><b>Solving Equations:</b> Equations involve finding the value of the variable that satisfies the equality. Techniques such as isolating the variable, using inverse operations, and solving systems of equations are used to solve a wide range of algebraic equations.</li>
            <li><b>Factoring:</b> Factoring involves breaking down algebraic expressions into simpler terms. This technique is particularly useful for solving quadratic equations and simplifying complex expressions.</li>
            <li><b>Graphing:</b> Graphing equations allows us to visualize the relationship between variables and identify key properties such as intercepts, slopes, and symmetry.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>How It Works:</h2>
    <p>Algebra serves as the cornerstone of many mathematical concepts. At its core, it involves manipulating mathematical symbols and solving equations to understand relationships between variables. Key components include variables, equations, and expressions. Algebraic equations are the basis for Algebra 1. The goal is to move the X to one side to solve for the X using SADMEG, the reverse of PEMDAS

    <h2>Walkthrough:</h2>
    <p>Solving a Simple Linear Equation:
      <ul>
        <li>Consider the Equation: 2x + 5 = 11</li>
        <li>Isolate the Variable: Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 6</li>
        <li>Divide both sides by 2: x = 3</li>
        <li>x is equal to 3.</li>
        <li>You can double-check your work by plugging 3 as X in the equation: 2 (3) + 5 = 11. This holds true, meaning x=3 is correct.</li>
      </ul>
