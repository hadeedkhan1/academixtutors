    <h2>How It Works:</h2>
    <p>Fractions and decimals are fundamental mathematical concepts that play a crucial role in representing and manipulating parts of a whole or values between whole numbers. Understanding how to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with fractions and decimals is essential for solving a wide range of mathematical problems. </p>
    <p><b>Fractions:</b> A fraction is a way of expressing a part of a whole. It consists of a numerator (the top number) and a denominator (the bottom number). The numerator represents the part we have, and the denominator represents the total number of equal parts that make up a whole. Operations with Fractions: <br><b>Addition and Subtraction:</b> To add or subtract fractions, ensure they have a common denominator. Add or subtract the numerators and keep the common denominator. <br>Example: 2/3 + 1/4 = 8/12 + 3/12 = 11/12 or 3/2 ​ + 4/1 ​ = 12/8 <br><b>Multiplication:</b> Multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator. Multiply the denominators together to get the new denominator. <br>Example: 3/5 × 2/3 = 6/15 or 5/3 ​ × 3/2 ​ = 15/6 ​ <br><b>Division:</b> Invert the second fraction (reciprocal) and then multiply. <br>Example: 3/4 ÷ 1/2 = 3/4 × 2/1 = 6/4 = 3/2 or 4/3 ​ ÷ 2/1 ​ = 4/3 ​ × 1/2 ​ = 4/6 ​ = 2/3 ​ <br><br><b>Decimals:</b> Decimals represent parts of a whole and are based on powers of 10. Each digit in a decimal has a place value, such as units, tenths, hundredths, and so on. Operations with Decimals: <br><b>Addition and Subtraction:</b> Align the decimal points and add or subtract as if dealing with whole numbers. Adjust the decimal point in the result accordingly. <br>Example: 0.6 + 0.25 = 0.85 0.6+0.25 = 0.85 <br><b>Multiplication:</b> Multiply as if dealing with whole numbers. Count the total decimal places in the factors and place the decimal point in the result accordingly. <br>Example: 1.5 × 0.2 = 0.3 1.5×0.2=0.3 <br><b>Division:</b> Divide as if dealing with whole numbers. Count the total decimal places in the dividend and divisor and place the decimal point in the quotient accordingly. <br>Example: 2.4 ÷ 0.6 = 4 2.4÷0.6=4 Understanding the principles of
